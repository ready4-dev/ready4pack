The tools in ready4pack are designed to make it easier to consistently author R packages that are collections of modules for models developed with the [ready4 framework](https://www.ready4-dev.com).

This development version of the ready4pack package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. 

A brief overview of the intended use of `ready4pack` classes and methods is available at:
