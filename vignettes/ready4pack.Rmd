The tools in ready4pack are designed to make it easier to consistently author R packages that are collections of modules for [ready4 - an open source health economic model of the systems shaping mental health and wellbeing in young people](https://www.ready4-dev.com).

This development version of the ready4pack package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. 

A brief overview of the intended use of `ready4pack` classes and methods is available at:
