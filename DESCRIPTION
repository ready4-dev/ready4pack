Description: ready4pack provides a set of tools for authoring R packages
    of functions, classes, methods and datasets that extend the ready4
    framework for open source, modular mental health systems models.  This
    development version of the ready4pack package has been made available
    as part of the process of testing and documenting the package.
    Therefore you should only trial this software if you feel confident
    that you understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in
    which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions,
    please contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
